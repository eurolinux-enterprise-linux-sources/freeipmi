.SH "NAME"
bmc-config \- configure BMC values
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B bmc-config
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Bmc-config
is used to get and set BMC configuration parameters, such as
usernames, passwords, networking information, security,
Serial-over-LAN (SOL), and other core IPMI fields. This configuration
is required before most IPMI tools can be used to access a machine
remotely.

The majority of
configuration operations require ADMIN privilege when using
.B bmc-config
out-of-band. Although connecting via a user with ADMIN privileges is
not required for out-of-band use, the vast majority of configuration
options will not be retrieved or set.

For configuration of platform event filtering (PEF), sensors, or
chassis, please see the
.B pef-config(8),
.B ipmi-sensors-config(8),
or
.B ipmi-chassis-config(8)
tools respectively.

.LP
See GENERAL USE below for a description on how most will want to use
.B Bmc-config.

HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.
If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The
user must have atleast ADMIN privileges in order for this tool to
operate fully.

\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-k-g\fR=\fIK_G\fR
Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote
host for IPMI 2.0. If not specified, a null key is assumed. To input
the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with '0x'. E.g., the
key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the
string '0x616263'
.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-k-g-prompt\fR
Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.

.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-cipher\-suite-id\fR=\fICIPHER-SUITE-ID\fR
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID
identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authentication
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session setup, the
integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the algorithm
to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not
specified. The following cipher suite ids are currently supported:
.sp

Output a help list and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Output a usage message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Output the program version and exit.
.SH "CONFIG OPTIONS"
The following options are used to read, write, and find differences
in configuration values.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-checkout\fR
Fetch configuration information.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-commit\fR
Update configuration information from a config file or key pairs.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-diff\fR
Show differences between stored information and a config file or key pairs.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR FILENAME, \fB\-\-filename\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
Specify a config file for checkout/commit/diff.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR "KEY=VALUE", \fB\-\-key\-pair=\fR"KEY=VALUE"
Specify KEY=VALUE pairs for checkout/commit/diff. Specify KEY by
SectionName:FieldName. This option can be used multiple times. On
commit, any KEY=VALUE pairs will overwrite any pairs specified in a
file with \fB\-\-filename\fR.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR "SECTION", \fB\-\-section=\fR"SECTION"
Specify a SECTION for checkout. This option can be used multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-listsections\fR
List available sections for checkout.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Output additional detailed information. In general will output more
detailed information about what fields can and cannot be checked out,
committed, etc. When used with \-\-checkout, additional uncommon,
unconfigurable, and/or unused fields may be output.
.SH "HOSTRANGED OPTIONS"
The following options manipulate hostranged output. See HOSTRANGED
SUPPORT below for additional information on hostranges.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-buffer-output\fR
Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard output until
the node has completed its IPMI operation. When specifying this
option, data may appear to output slower to the user since the the
entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.
See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-consolidate-output\fR
Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output from
every node specified will be consolidated so that nodes with identical
output are not output twice. A header will list those nodes with the
consolidated output. When this option is specified, no output can be
seen until the IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If the
user breaks out of the program early, all currently consolidated
output will be dumped. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional
information.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-fanout\fR
Specify multiple host fanout. A "sliding window" (or fanout)
algorithm is used for parallel IPMI communication so that slower nodes
or timed out nodes will not impede parallel communication. The
maximum number of threads available at the same time is limited by the
fanout. The default is 64.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-eliminate\fR
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by
.B ipmidetect.
This attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed from service in a large
cluster. The
.B ipmidetectd
daemon must be running on the node executing the command.
.TP
\fB\-\-always\-prefix\fR
Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for
scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with
the \fB\-C\fR option.
.SH "GENERAL USE"
Most users of will want to:
.LP
A) Run with --checkout to get a copy of the current configuration and
store it in a file. The standard output can be redirected to a file
or a file can be specified with the --filename option.
.LP
B) Edit the configuration file with an editor.
.LP
C) Commit the configuration back using the --commit option and
specifying the configuration file with the --filename option. The
configuration can be committed to multiple hosts in parallel via the
hostrange support.
.LP
Comments throughout the checked out file will give instructions on how
to configure the fields.
The
.B bmc-config.conf(5)
also provides additional information on the meaning of different fields.
.LP
For users with large clusters or sets of nodes, you may wish to use
the same configuration file for all nodes. The one problem with this
is that the IP address and MAC address will be different on each node
in your cluster and thus can't be configured through the same config
file. The IP address and MAC address in your config file may be
overwritten on the command line using --key-pair option. The
following example could be used in a script to configure each node in
a cluster with the same BMC config file. The script only needs to
determine the correct IP address and MAC address to use.
.LP
.B # bmc-config --commit -k "Lan_Conf:Ip_Address=$MY_IP" -k "Lan_Conf:Mac_Address=$MY_MAC" -n my_bmc.conf
.SH "BMC-CONFIG SPECIAL CASE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION"
The
.B UserN:Password
fields (where N is a number) cannot be checked out on some systems,
therefore the checked out value will always be blank.
The
.B UserN:Enable_User
field (where N is a number) cannot be checked out on older IPMI
systems, therefore the checked out value will sometime be blank.
The
.B UserN:Lan_Session_Limit
and
.B UserN:Serial_Session_Limit
fields (where N is a number) cannot be checked out on some systems,
therefore the checked out value will always be blank. If not
specified in later commits of configurations, the field may be reset
to 0 due to a requirement that other fields (configured along with the
session limit) will require an input value for the session limit.
Under most conditions, it is not necessary to set this field and most
users may choose to ignore it. This field is considered optional by
IPMI standards, and may result in errors when attempting to configure
it to a non-zero value. If errors to occur, setting the value back to
0 should resolve problems.
The fields
.B Lan_Conf:IP_Address
and
.B Lan_Conf:MAC_Address
cannot be committed in parallel via hostrange support. Each machine
must be configured with a unique IP Address and MAC Address tuple,
therefore we disallow this configuration in
.B bmc-config.
On some motherboards,
.B Lan_Conf:MAC_Address
may be read only and the MAC address is automatically configured.
On some motherboards, a number of user configuration fields cannot be
read or configured until after a non-null username or non-null
password is configured. In some of these cases, an appropriate output
in the config file will indicate this situation. However, not all
motherboard corner cases may be detected. Users may wish to play
around with the ordering of fields to work around these problems.
On some motherboards, OEM Authentication in
.B Lan_Conf_Auth
cannot be enabled. However, the default motherboard settings have
these fields enabled. Users are advised to disable all OEM
Authentication in this section.
.SH "HOSTRANGED SUPPORT"
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated
lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the general form:
prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc. The later form
should not be confused with regular expression character classes (also
denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or foo9,
but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.
.LP
This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].
.LP
Some examples of range usage follow:
.nf
    foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
    foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
    foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3
.fi
.LP
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([
and ]) for pattern matching. Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.
.LP
By default, standard output from each node specified will be output
with the hostname prepended to each line. Although this output is
readable in many situations, it may be difficult to read in other
situations. For example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed
together. The \fB\-B\fR and \fB\-C\fR options can be used to change
this default.
.LP
In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host "localhost" is
specified. This allows the user to add the localhost into the
hostranged output.
.SH "GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING"
Most often, IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the
remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure the following are
configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC
address, subnet mask, username, user enablement, user privilege,
password, LAN privilege, LAN enablement, and allowed authentication
type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the
cipher suite privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
.B bmc-config(8)
tool can be used to check and/or change these configuration
settings.
.LP
The following are common issues for given error messages:
.LP
"username invalid" - The username entered (or a NULL username if none
was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also be
possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.
.LP
"password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none
was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the password for
the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"password verification timeout" - Password verification has timed out.
A "password invalid" error (described above) or a generic "session
timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this point in the
protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.
.LP
"k_g invalid" - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"privilege level insufficient" - An IPMI command requires a higher
user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating
to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.
.LP
"privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" - The privilege
level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than the
maximum allowed for this user. Please try again with a lower
privilege. It may also be possible the maximum privilege level
allowed for a user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level" - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not available for
this privilege level. Please try again with an alternate
authentication type or alternate privilege level. It may also be
possible the available authentication types you can authenticate with
are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please try
again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the
available cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote
BMC.
.LP
"ipmi 2.0 unavailable" - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote
machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.
.LP
"connection timeout" - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of
potential errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled
on the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify configuration and connectivity.
.LP
"session timeout" - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.
.LP
If IPMI over LAN continually times out, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than
others.
.LP
Please see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any vendor specific
bugs that have been discovered and worked around.
.SH "WORKAROUNDS"
With so many different vendors implementing their
own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following lists the handful of
compliance issues discovered and the workarounds currently
supported.
.LP
When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they will be
transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to
specify a workaround be used via the -W option.
.LP
The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a
problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the
problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or may
not exhibit the same problems.
.LP
Intel SR870BN4: BMCs would not respond to retransmissions of a Get
Session Challenge Request if a previous Get Session Challenge response
was lost. Resolved by sending retransmitted Get Session Challenge
requests from a different source port. Automatically handled.
.LP
Tyan S2882 with m3289 BMC: After the IPMI session is brought up,
packet responses return empty session IDs to the client. This will
likely cause "session timeout" errors to occur. In order to work
around this issue, the "idzero" workaround must be specified. The
option will allow empty session IDs to be accepted by the client.
.LP
Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425: When Per-Message Authentication is
disabled, packet responses contain non-null authentication data (when
it should in fact be null). This will likely cause "session timeout"
errors to occur. In order to work around this issue, the
"unexpectedauth" workaround must be specified. The option will allow
unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked as though they were
expected. This compliance bug is confirmed to be fixed on newer
firmware.
.LP
IBM eServer 325: The remote BMC will advertise that Per Message
Authentication is disabled, but actually require it for the protocol.
This will likely cause "session timeout" errors to occur. In order to
work around this issue, the "forcepermsg" workaround must be
specified. The option will force Per Message Authentication to be
used no matter what is advertised by the remote BMC.
.LP
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card: The remote BMC will
advertise that Per Message Authentication is disabled, but actually
require it for the protocol. Automatically handled.
.LP
Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4: The motherboard does not properly
report username capabilities and/or K_g status. This will likely
cause "username invalid" or "k_g invalid" errors to occur. In order
to work around this issue, the "authcap" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: The motherboard does not properly report
username capabilities and/or K_g status. This will likely cause
"username invalid" or "k_g invalid" errors to occur. In order to work
around this issue, the "authcap" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0: The session sequence numbers returned for IPMI 1.5
sessions are the wrong endian on some systems running ILOM 1.0/2.0.
The incorrect endian depends on the service processor endianness.
This will likely cause "session timeout" errors to occur. In order to
work around this issue, the "endianseq" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM: The motherboard does not properly
report username capabilities. This will likely cause "username
invalid" errors to occur.  In order to work around this issue, the
"authcap" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional
Edition): There are a number of Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication bugs.
These problems may cause "username invalid", "password invalid", or
"k_g invalid" errors to occur. They can be worked around by
specifying the "intel20" workaround. The workarounds include padding
of usernames, automatic acceptance of a RAKP 4 response integrity
check when using the integrity algorithm MD5-128, and password
truncation if the authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128.
.LP
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card: There are several
Supermicro IPMI 2.0 bugs on early firmware revisions which can be
worked around using the "supermicro20" workaround. These problems may
cause "password invalid" errors to occur. These compliance bugs are
confirmed to be fixed on newer firmware.
.LP
Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM: There are several Sun IPMI 2.0
bugs. These problems may cause "password invalid" or "bmc error"
errors to occur. They can be worked around by specifying the "sun20"
workaround. The workarounds include handling invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records.
.LP
Inventec 5441, Supermicro X8DTH: The privilege level sent during the
Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys
instead of the privilege level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage.
This may cause "password invalid" or "bad rmcpplus status code" errors
to occur. It can be worked around by specifying the "opensesspriv"
workaround.

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
On older operating systems, if you input your username, password,
and other potentially security relevant information on the command
line, this information may be discovered by other users when using
tools like the
.B ps(1)
command or looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the -P or -K
options. Configuring security relevant information in the FreeIPMI
configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.
.LP
In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily
"lock up" after a number of remote authentication errors. You may
need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass
before you may authenticate again.
