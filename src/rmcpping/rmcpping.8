.TH RMCPING 8 "2009-11-30" "rmcpping 0.7.16" "System Manager Commands"
.SH "NAME"
rmcpping \- send RMCP Ping to network hosts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B rmcpping
[\fIOPTION\fR...] destination
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B rmcpping
uses the RMCP Ping request datagram to elicit an RMCP Pong response
from a remote host. The utility can be used to verify if a remote
host supports RMCP or IPMI. The initial starting sequence number will
be randomized.

.B rmcpping
will return 0 to the environment if it receives atleast 1 response
from the remote host. Otherwise, it exits with a value of 1.
.SH "OPTIONS"
The following options are available
.TP
.I "-h"
Output help menu.
.TP
.I "-V"
Output version.
.TP
.I "-c count"
Stop after sending
.I count
packets.
.TP
.I "-i interval"
Wait
.I interval
seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one
second between each packet.
.TP
.I "-I interface address"
Set source address to specified interface address. Argument may
be numeric IP address or name of device.
.TP
.I "-t timeout"
Time to wait for a response, in seconds. Default is five seconds.
.TP
.I "-v"
Verbose output.
.TP
.I "-s num"
Specify an initial starting sequence number. The default is to use a
random initial sequence number.
.TP
.I "-d"
Turn on debugging.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and
delay packet responses if duplicate packets (with duplicate sequence
numbers) are sent in succession very quickly. There is no known way
to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC other than the wait awhile.
.PP
Unlike
.B ping(8),
local network devicess (i.e. 127.0.0.1) cannot be "pinged".
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <freeipmi\-users@gnu.org> or <freeipmi\-devel@gnu.org>.
