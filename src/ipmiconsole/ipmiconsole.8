.TH ipmiconsole 8 "2009-11-30" "ipmiconsole 0.7.16" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
ipmiconsole \- IPMI console utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmiconsole
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ipmiconsole
is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL) console utility. It can be used to establish
console sessions to remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL protocol.

.SH "IPMI 2.0 SOL"
.B Ipmiconsole
communicates with a remote machine's Baseboard Management Controller
(BMC) to establish a console session. Before any SOL communication
can take place, the remote machine's BMC must be configured properly.
Of primary importance, the IP address, MAC address, subnet, usernames,
passwords, privileges, SOL availability, SOL privilege, and SOL user
access must be configured and enabled. The FreeIPMI tool
.B bmc-config(1)
may be used to do this configuration. A BMC configuration tool may
have also been distributed with the machine.
.LP
Often (although not always), console redirection must be also
be configured properly in the BIOS and/or operating system. Both must
be configured to redirect console traffic out the appropriate COM port.
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
The following options are general options for configuring IPMI
communication and executing general tool commands.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-hostname\fR=\fIIPMIHOST\fR
Specify the remote host to communicate with.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-username\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify the username to use when authenticating with the remote host.
If not specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The
user must a high enough privilege to establish a SOL session and have
SOL session abilities.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR=\fIPASSWORD\fR
Specify the password to use when authenticationg with the remote host.
If not specified, a null password is assumed. Maximum password length
is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-password-prompt\fR
Prompt for password to avoid possibility of listing
it in process lists.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-k-g\fR=\fIK_G\fR
Specify the K_g BMC key to use when authenticating with the remote
host for IPMI 2.0. If not specified, a null key is assumed. To input
the key in hexadecimal form, prefix the string with '0x'. E.g., the
key 'abc' can be entered with the either the string 'abc' or the
string '0x616263'
.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-k-g-prompt\fR
Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of listing it in process lists.
.TP
\fB\-\-session-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify the session timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000
milliseconds (60 seconds) if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-\-retransmission-timeout\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR

to 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-cipher\-suite-id\fR=\fICIPHER-SUITE-ID\fR
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID
identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and confidentiality
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authentication
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session setup, the
integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the algorithm
to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not
specified. The user should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8,
and 12 encrypt console payloads. Console information will be sent in
the clear an alternate cipher suite id is selected. The following
cipher suite ids are currently supported:
.sp
0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None
.sp
1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None
.sp

Turn on debugging.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Output a help list and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Output a usage message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Output the program version and exit.
.if 1 \{
.TP
\fB\-\-debugfile\fR
Output debugging to the debugfile rather than to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-noraw\fR
Don't enter terminal raw mode.
\}
.SH "IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS"
The following options are specific to
.B Ipmiconsole.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-escape-char\fR=\fICHAR\fR
Specify an alternate escape character (default char '&').
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-dont-steal\fR
Do not steal an SOL session if one is already detected as being in
use. Under most circumstances, if SOL is detected as being in use,
.B ipmiconsole
will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the previous session.
This default behavior exists for several reasons, most notably that
earlier SOL sessions may have not been able to be deactivate properly.
.TP

.SH "ESCAPE CHARACTERS"
The following escape sequences are supported. The default supported
escape character is '&', but can be changed with the
\fB\-e\fR
option.
.TP
.I &?
Display a list of currently available escape sequences.
.TP
.I &.
Terminate the connection.
.TP
.I &B
Send a "serial-break" to the remote console.
.TP
.I &D
Send a DEL character.
.TP
.I &&
Send a single escape character.
.SH "GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING"
Most often, IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the
remote machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure the following are
configured properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC
address, subnet mask, username, user enablement, user privilege,
password, LAN privilege, LAN enablement, and allowed authentication
type(s). For IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the
cipher suite privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
.B bmc-config(8)
tool can be used to check and/or change these configuration
settings.
.LP
The following are common issues for given error messages:
.LP
"username invalid" - The username entered (or a NULL username if none
was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also be
possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.
.LP
"password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none
was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the password for
the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"password verification timeout" - Password verification has timed out.
A "password invalid" error (described above) or a generic "session
timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this point in the
protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.
.LP
"k_g invalid" - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"privilege level insufficient" - An IPMI command requires a higher
user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating
to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.
.LP
"privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" - The privilege
level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than the
maximum allowed for this user. Please try again with a lower
privilege. It may also be possible the maximum privilege level
allowed for a user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level" - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not available for
this privilege level. Please try again with an alternate
authentication type or alternate privilege level. It may also be
possible the available authentication types you can authenticate with
are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please try
again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the
available cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote
BMC.
.LP
"ipmi 2.0 unavailable" - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote
machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.
.LP
"connection timeout" - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of
potential errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled
on the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify configuration and connectivity.
.LP
"session timeout" - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.
.LP
If IPMI over LAN continually times out, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than
others.
.LP
Please see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any vendor specific
bugs that have been discovered and worked around.
.SH "IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING"
The following are common issues for given error messages specifically
for
.B ipmiconsole.
.LP
"SOL unavailable" - SOL is not configured for use on the remote BMC.
It may be not configured in general or for the specific user
specified. Authenticating with a different user may be sufficient,
however the IPMI protocol does not reveal detail on what is not
configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"SOL in use" - SOL is already in use on the remote BMC. If you do not
specify the
.I --dont-steal
option,
.B ipmiconsole
will attempt to steal the SOL session away from the other session.
.LP
"SOL session stolen" - Your SOL session has been stolen by another
session. You may wish to try and steal the session back by reconnecting.
.LP
"SOL requires encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
includes encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12.
It may also be possible the encryption requirements are not configured
correctly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"SOL requires no encryption" - SOL requires a cipher suite id that
does not use encryption. Please try to use cipher suite id 0, 1, 2,
6, 7, or 11. It may also be possible the encryption requirements are
not configured correctly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"BMC Implementation" - The BMC on the remote machine has a severe
problem in its implementation. Please see the WORKAROUNDS section
below for possible workarounds. If additional vendor workarounds are
required, please contact the authors.
.LP
"excess retransmissions sent" - An excessive number of retransmissions
of SOL packets has occurred and
.B ipmiconsole
has given up. This may be due to network issues or SOL issues. Some
of the same issues involved with "connection timeout" or "session
timeout" errors may be involved.  Please try to reconnect.
.LP
"excess errors received" - An excessive number of SOL packet errors
has occurred and
.B ipmiconsole
has given up. This may be due to network issues or SOL issues.
Please try to reconnect.
.LP
"BMC Error" - This error usually means a vendor SOL implementation
requires a combination of authentication, encryption, privilege,
etc. that have not been met by the user's choices.  Please try a
combination of different cipher suites, privileges, etc. to resolve
the problem.
.SH "WORKAROUNDS"
With so many different vendors implementing their
own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement their IPMI
protocols incorrectly. The following lists the handful of
compliance issues discovered and the workarounds currently
supported.
.LP
When possible, workarounds have been implemented so they will be
transparent to the user. However, some will require the user to
specify a workaround be used via the -W option.
.LP
The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a
problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the
problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or may
not exhibit the same problems.
.LP
Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4: The motherboard does not properly
report username capabilities and/or K_g status. This will likely
cause "username invalid" or "k_g invalid" errors to occur. In order
to work around this issue, the "authcap" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: The motherboard does not properly report
username capabilities and/or K_g status. This will likely cause
"username invalid" or "k_g invalid" errors to occur. In order to work
around this issue, the "authcap" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional
Edition): There are a number of Intel IPMI 2.0 authentcation and SOL
connection bugs. These problems may cause "username invalid",
"password invalid", "k_g invalid", or "BMC Error" errors to occur.
They can be worked around by specifying the "intel20" workaround. The
workarounds include padding of usernames, automatic acceptance of a
RAKP 4 response integrity check when using the integrity algorithm
MD5-128, password truncation if the authentication algorithm is
HMAC-MD5-128, and specifying Intel IPMI 2.0 specific SOL connection
parameters.
.LP
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card: There are several
Supermicro IPMI 2.0 bugs on early firmware revisions which can be
worked around using the "supermicro20" workaround. These problems may
cause "password invalid" errors to occur. These compliance bugs are
confirmed to be fixed on newer firmware.
.LP
Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM: There are several Sun IPMI 2.0
bugs. These problems may cause "password invalid" or "bmc error"
errors to occur. They can be worked around by specifying the "sun20"
workaround. The workarounds include handling invalid lengthed hash
keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records.
.LP
Inventec 5441, Supermicro X8DTH: The privilege level sent during the
Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys
instead of the privilege level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage.
This may cause "password invalid" or "BMC Error" errors to occur. It
can be worked around by specifying the "opensesspriv" workaround.
.LP
Asus P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441, Sun
x4100, Supermicro X8DTH: Incorrect IPMI 2.0 SOL payload sizes are
reported by motherboard SOL packet responses. This will likely cause
"BMC Implementation" errors to occur. In order to work around this
issue, the "solpayloadsize" workaround must be specified.
.LP
Asus P5MT-R, Supermicro X8DTH-iF: An invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL port is
reported by the motherboard. This may cause "connection timeout"
errors to occur. In order to work around this issue, the "solport"
workaround must be specified.
.LP
Supermicro X8SIL-F: The Get Payload Activation Status command isn't
supported. This may cause "BMC Error" errors to occur. In order to
work around this issue, the "solstatus" workaround must be specified.
.SH "SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES"
Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: After a reboot, the SOL session appears to
"disconnect" from the motherboard but stay alive.
Character data input from the
.B ipmiconsole
client is accepted by the remote machine, but no character data or
console data is ever sent back from the remote machine. The SOL
session is subsequently useless. There is currently no workaround in
place to handle this. The session must be closed and restarted.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.B # ipmiconsole -h ahost -u myusername -p mypassword
.PP
Establish a console sesssion with a remote host.
.PP
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
On older operating systems, if you input your username, password,
and other potentially security relevant information on the command
line, this information may be discovered by other users when using
tools like the
.B ps(1)
command or looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the -P or -K
options. Configuring security relevant information in the FreeIPMI
configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.
.LP
In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily
"lock up" after a number of remote authentication errors. You may
need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass
before you may authenticate again.
.if 1 \{
This version of ipmiconsole was compiled with debugging. When compiled
with debugging,
.B ipmiconsole
is insecure. The following were intentionally
left in
.B ipmiconsole
for debugging purposes:
.IP o 2
Sensitive command line arguments are not cleared from memory.
.IP o
Core dumps are enabled.
Before placing ipmiconsole in a production system, it is recommended
that the program be compiled with debugging turned off.
